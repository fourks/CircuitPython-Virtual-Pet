# CircuitPython Virtual Pet
 Virtual Pet / Tamgagotchi-like software written for CircuitPython

Written specifically for my CircuitPython badge device (GitHub URL here). Could be tailored to work with any CircuitPython device with 3 buttons and an SD1306 or SH1106 OLED driver with 128x64 resolution.
